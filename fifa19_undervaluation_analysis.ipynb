    "# FIFA 19 Player Undervaluation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Student:** Shola Lajuwomi\n",
    "* **Class:** AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a Jupyter Notebook (for Kaggle/GitHub) that performs unsupervised learning (DBSCAN) on the FIFA 19 player dataset to identify potentially undervalued player archetypes within specific positions (e.g., Strikers). The analysis focuses on clustering players based on position-specific composite skill metrics versus their market value ('Value'). The notebook will follow the structure required for the AI class assignment, including introduction, EDA, preprocessing, model training/tuning, and conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "-   AI Course Instructor (Mr. Dole) for assignment evaluation.\n",
    "-   CS students interested in a practical unsupervised learning example.\n",
    "-   Football analysts/enthusiasts interested in player valuation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis uses the \"FIFA 19 Complete Player Dataset\" available on Kaggle:\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Identifying potentially undervalued player archetypes in the FIFA 19 dataset using unsupervised learning. Standard valuation methods might overlook players who offer high skill relative to their market price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** To cluster players within selected positions (starting with Strikers 'ST') based on a composite skill score versus their market value ('Value_EUR'). The aim is to use DBSCAN to identify distinct groups, particularly focusing on clusters representing high-skill, low-value players (\"undervalued archetypes\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Source:** The analysis utilizes the \"FIFA 19 Complete Player Dataset\" sourced from Kaggle.\n",
    "* Dataset Link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-19-complete-player-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-19-complete-player-dataset)\n",
    "*(Note: This URL is specified in the technical specification, though the README might reference another URL. This analysis will proceed using the specification URL.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology Outline:**\n",
    "1.  **Data Loading & Initial Exploration:** Load the dataset and perform preliminary checks.\n",
    "2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data, handle missing values, convert data types (e.g., height, weight, currency).\n",
    "3.  **Feature Engineering:** Define and calculate a composite skill score for the target position(s).\n",
    "4.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize distributions and relationships in the cleaned data and engineered features.\n",
    "5.  **Feature Scaling:** Scale the selected features (skill score, value) for clustering.\n",
    "6.  **Unsupervised Learning (DBSCAN):** Apply DBSCAN to the scaled data, including hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "7.  **Results Analysis:** Visualize clusters, identify undervalued groups, and examine sample players.\n",
    "8.  **Conclusion:** Summarize findings, evaluate the model, discuss limitations, and suggest future work."
